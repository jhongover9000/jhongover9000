- 👋 Hi, I’m Joseph!
- 👀 I’m interested in a *lot* of things. Creative writing, reading, theater, coding, biology, sports... The list goes on and on. I consider myself something of a jack-of-all-trades, or at least I try to be. I find that it's really fun learning new skills and continuing to improve on them. I have a lot of interests, but my goal has remained the same: to learn and to enjoy learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science and Interactive Media at New York University Abu Dhabi. I have experience in Python, C, C++, and Java, as well as Processing and Arduino. I also dabble with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! I also have experience in design software like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and XD.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, well, anything that I can help with!
- 📫 You can reach me through email at joseph.hong@nyu.edu!
